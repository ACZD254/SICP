OKay so let me get this straight.
Ben wants us to have Global which will hold the make account def.
when make account is run, it creates E1 which in turn creates E2 and E3 due to the let statements
E3 holds the protected withdraw and deposit functions and the definition of Dispatch.
When dispatch is run, it returns an environment with a pointer to E3.
Okay, that's cool.
So where is the issue exactly?
Would there be a change in concurrency?
Absolutely not.
Is it a safe change to make? In my eyes - Yes!
