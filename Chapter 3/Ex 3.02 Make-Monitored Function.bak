What is the book asking me to do?
Its asking me to say yes to new and unknown challenges, enthusiastically.

;What our function is supposed to do.
;Takes as an input a procedure f
;and f takes one input
;returns a procedure that keeps track
;of how many times it itself is called.

;Okay, so this should be easy.

(define (make-monitored f)
  (let ((function-calls 0))
    (lambda (input)
      (cond ((eq? input 'how-many-calls) function-calls)
            ((eq? input 'reset-count) (set! function-calls 0))
            (else (set! function-calls (+ 1 function-calls)) (f input))))))

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define monitored-square (make-monitored square))

(monitored-square 2)

(monitored-square 'how-many-calls)

;Okay, so this seems to be working.
;Moving on.
