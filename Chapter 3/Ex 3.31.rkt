So the thing that bothers me the most about this implementation is that
the order of procedures is reversed in (call-each procedures)

Why would you do that?

To answer the question in consideration,
there is nothing changing the state of the wire unless and until the procedure is run once.
So in order to change the state, we need the initialization.

But what I am really trying to find the answer to is the question stated above.
Why are we adding procedures to the top of the pile?
