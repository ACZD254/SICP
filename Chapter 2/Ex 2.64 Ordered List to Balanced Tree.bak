#|Ex 2.64 Ordered List to Tree
@Author - Soumitra Pandit

The idea is to convert an Ordered List to a Balanced Tree
And I think I can do that.
Its all predicated on our definition of "balance".
Lets try this.|#

;================================================
;Implementing a Tree Structure
;================================================
(define (make-tree element left right)
  (list element left right))

(define (element tree)
  (car tree))

(define (left-subtree tree)
  (cadr tree))

(define (right-subtree tree)
  (caddr tree))

(define tree-1 (make-tree 3 (make-tree 2 '() '()) (make-tree 4 '() '())))
(define tree-0 (make-tree 5 tree-1 (make-tree 6 '() '())))

;------------------------------------------------------------------------
;Test trees

(define test-tree1 (make-tree 7
                               (make-tree 3
                                          (make-tree 1 '() '())
                                          (make-tree 5 '() '()))
                               (make-tree 9
                                          '()
                                          (make-tree 11 '() '()))))

(define test-tree2 (make-tree 3
                               (make-tree 1
                                          '()
                                          '())
                               (make-tree 7
                                          (make-tree 5 '() '())
                                          (make-tree 9
                                                     '()
                                                     (make-tree 11
                                                                '()
                                                                '())))))

(define test-tree3 (make-tree 5
                               (make-tree 3
                                          (make-tree 1 '() '())
                                          '())
                               (make-tree 9
                                          (make-tree 7 '() '())
                                          (make-tree 11 '() '()))))

;Okay, so how do we do this?
;When is a tree balanced?
;How many subcases would I have to define?
;Lets say the set is empty
;Then that's the balanced tree
;If not, the set eithr has even number of elements
;OR an odd number of elements.

;IF we start with an odd number of elements,
;we can go to the middle of the list, get that element and have that
;as the begining of the tree.
;The left subtree would consist of the elements to the left of the middle,
;and the right subtree would consist of the elements to the right of the middle.
;At some point, we'd reach two elements.
;And how we deal with two elements is going to be the key to this thing.

;If we start with a single element, then that's it, we already have the tree.

;Let me write pseudo code for this. But this is really easy imo.

(define (list->tree set)
  (cond ((null? set) '())
        ((= (length set) 1) (make-tree (car set) '() '()))
        ((= (length set) 2) (make-tree (car set) '() (list->tree (cdr set))))
        (else (make-tree (middle-of-set set) (list->tree (left-half set)) (list->tree (right-half set))))))

(define (accumulate op base-value seq)
  (if (null? seq)
      base-value
      (op (car seq) (accumulate op base-value (cdr seq)))))

(define (length set)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y) (+ 1 y)) 0 set))

(define (middle-of-set set)
  (define (nth-element set n)
    (if (= n 0)
        (car set)
        (nth-element (cdr set) (- n 1))))
  (cond ((null? set) 0)
        ((= (length set) 1) (car set))
        (else (nth-element set (/ (length set) 2)))))

(define (split-set set)
  (define (nth-split set n result-set)
    (if (= 0 n)
        (cons result-set set)
        (nth-split (cdr set) (- n 1) (cons (car set) result-set))))
  (nth-split set (/ (length set) 2) '()))

(define (right-half set)
  (cdr (split-set set)))

(define (left-half set)
  (car (split-set set)))

;========================================================================
;Testing

(define test-set1 (list 1 2 3 4 5 6))
(define test-set2 (list 1 2 3))
(define test-set3 (list 1 2))
(define test-set4 '())
(define test-set5 (list 1))

(length test-set1)
(length test-set2)
(length test-set3)
(length test-set4)
(length test-set5)

(middle-of-set test-set1)
(/ 3 2)
;(middle-of-set test-set2)
;(middle-of-set test-set3)
;(middle-of-set test-set4)
;(middle-of-set test-set5)
