#|For Each

The idea behind "for each" is that it applies a procedure to
each element of the list but does not return the list
|#


(define (for-each func seq)
  (if (null? seq)
      (and (newline) true)
      (and (func (car seq)) (for-each func (cdr seq)))))


(for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
          (list 57 321 88))


;Works :)
