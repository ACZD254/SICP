(define (make-mobile left right)
  (list left right))

;I guess I am still struggling with the idea that a list in itself is
;a compound structure. Maybe, I should stop thinking of it in terms of
;nested cons and look at it for what it is - a sequence.
;And then, cons is merely a tool to add an element to the beggining of the
;sequence. Which is pretty neat.
;But, I think I need to experiment just a bit more

(define exp1 (list (cons 1 2) (cons 3 4)))

(define exp2 (cons (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))

(define exp3 (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))

exp1
exp2
exp3
